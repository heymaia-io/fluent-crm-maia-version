# Custom Documentation

This folder contains documentation specific to the Maia customizations of FluentCRM.

## Files:

- **README.md** - Detailed installation guide, usage instructions, and technical details
- **CHANGELOG.md** - Complete list of modifications made to the original FluentCRM

## Why separate documentation?

- Keeps custom documentation organized and separate from original FluentCRM files
- Prevents conflicts if future FluentCRM updates include README.md or CHANGELOG.md files
- Makes it easy to understand what's been customized vs. original functionality

## Original FluentCRM Documentation

The original FluentCRM documentation files remain in the root directory:

- `readme.txt` - Original FluentCRM plugin information
