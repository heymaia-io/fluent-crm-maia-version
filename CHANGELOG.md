#### Code Changes

##### **PermissionManager.php** - Permission System Updates

- Updated `currentUserCan()` method to recognize `maia_fcrm_manager` capability as having full access to all FluentCRM features
- Updated `getUserPermissions()` method to grant all FluentCRM permissions to users with `maia_fcrm_manager` capability
- Ensures users with this capability have the same level of FluentCRM access as WordPress administrators

### Technical Implementation Details

The permission system modifications ensure that:

1. **Existing `maia_fcrm_manager` capability** is automatically recognized
2. **Full FluentCRM access** is granted without requiring WordPress administrator privileges
3. **Seamless integration** with existing FluentCRM permission system
4. **Capability-based access control** for dedicated FluentCRM managers

### Prerequisites

- The `maia_fcrm_manager` WordPress capability must already exist in the WordPress installation
- Users must be granted this capability through WordPress user management or plugins

### Usage

If the `maia_fcrm_manager` capability exists in WordPress:

1. Grant users this capability through WordPress Admin â†’ Users or capability management plugins
2. Users will automatically have full access to all FluentCRM features
3. No additional configuration required

### Notes

- **Original FluentCRM codebase**: All files are from the original FluentCRM version
- **Minimal modifications**: Only permission recognition was modified, no capability creation
- **Backward compatibility**: All existing functionality remains unchanged
- **External capability dependency**: Assumes `maia_fcrm_manager` capability exists independently
- **Security**: Capability recognition only grants FluentCRM-specific permissions
