# FluentCRM Maia Capability Integration - Summary

## What Changed

The FluentCRM integration has been updated to work with `maia_fcrm_manager` as a **WordPress capability** instead of a role.

## Current Implementation

### PermissionManager.php Changes:

1. **`getUserPermissions()` method**: Checks if user has `maia_fcrm_manager` capability and grants all FluentCRM permissions
2. **`currentUserCan()` method**: Returns `true` for any permission if user has `maia_fcrm_manager` capability

### How It Works:

- WordPress `current_user_can('maia_fcrm_manager')` checks if user has the capability
- WordPress `$user->has_cap('maia_fcrm_manager')` checks if user has the capability
- Both functions work identically for capabilities and roles

## User Experience:

- Any user granted the `maia_fcrm_manager` capability will have full FluentCRM access
- Equivalent to WordPress administrator access within FluentCRM
- No additional configuration needed

## Testing:

- Grant a user the `maia_fcrm_manager` capability: `$user->add_cap('maia_fcrm_manager')`
- User should immediately have full FluentCRM access
- Can be revoked with: `$user->remove_cap('maia_fcrm_manager')`

## Documentation Updated:

- ✅ CHANGELOG-MAIA.md - Updated to reflect capability instead of role
- ✅ README-MAIA.md - Updated instructions for capability management
- ✅ Code comments - Updated to reflect capability usage

The implementation is ready and should work perfectly with capability-based permissions!
